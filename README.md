CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

# Architecture
I would say that the main difference in structure is that the Express HTML customer-facing page is based on a model view controller that utilizes handlebars files for the views while the Angular project has a module and component structure that we developed. For each new feature that we added, we simply constructed a component that is imported into our app-router module and the app module. We have many typescript files with the Angular project. Angular SPAs are a very convenient useful tool in a full-stack skillset. The key reason why the backend uses a NoSQL MongoDB is that NoSQL databases can have an agile database schema as opposed to SQL databases that need to conform to a fixed schema. This allowed us to grow and modify our database as needed throughout the project.
# Functionality
JSON is different from JavaScript as it's text-only. It ties the front and back ends together as we can move data throughout our application in a format that is easily read in and manipulated. During the full-stack process, I constructed multiple hbs files that were used to simplify the HTML that was being written for the full stack application. This saves time in development and allows us to have consistency in our style/UI.
# Testing
I experienced multiple difficulties when testing my application when additional security measures were added. When I added authentication, I had issues with the authentication header not being parsed to the API endpoints, addTrip, and updateTrip specifically. This was an issue that needed to be resolved to have a fully functioning application that also utilized authentication.
# Reflection
This course helped push me towards my professional goals because it allowed me to further refine my skills with JavaScript. It also allowed me to learn some new technologies along the way that will help to make me a more marketable candidate in my career field. Specifically, learning a new technical stack (MEAN) will be a very beneficial addition to my current skill set.
